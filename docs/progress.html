                                        While it has taken us longer than expected to understand the algorithm, 
                                        we have successfully figured out how to use the The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) classes 
                                        to implement the algorithm described in “PARALLEL GUARANTEED QUALITY DELAUNAY UNIFORM MESH REFINEMENT” 
                                        by Chernikov and Chrisochoides. 
                                        We will primarily be using the CGAL::Delauay_mesher_2, 
                                        custom Criteria to effectively parallelize the process, 
                                        and the Geometric traits of the Delauay_mesher_2 class to do preprocessing calculations on the mesh. 

                                    </p>

                                        The general “coarse grain partitioning” algorithm presented by the paper is as follows: 
                                        do a single refinement of the entire mesh to establish bounds for “subdomains” 
                                        and their “buffer zones” so that those can be refined independently, 
                                        followed by evenly distributing those to different processors and refining them individually. 
                                        The refinement described in the paper, called “ParameterizedDelaunayRefinement”, 
                                        does essentially what GCAL::Delauay_mesher_2’s “refine” function does, 
                                        so we will use that in place of their pseudocode.

                                        After preprocessing and one refinement is done, 
                                        we can separate the subdomains using the clusters that build the mesher to then assign them to their initial processors. 
                                        In GCAL, a mesher is constructed from a list of Clusters, which are groupings of points. 
                                        With our list of lists of points, 
                                        it is possible to divide the mesh and independently refine each subdomain. 
                                        Additionally, to make optimizing one area of a subdomain possible, 
                                        we will introduce our own Criteria, 
                                        which GCAL uses to verify the validity of points as it refines the mesh. 
                                        When we introduce our own criterion, 
                                        we should be able to control which triangles of the mesh are refined first by indicating which are valid/invalid.

                                        For communication, we have decided to use a shared-address space message system, 
                                        where each message is of course a vector of points (more explained in “Challenges”). 
                                        Given these implementation details, we can assume the same input and output GCAL expects, 
                                        which is just a list of points, and use GCAL to step through the refinement process. 
                                        Stepping through the refinement process will help us both debug and visualize the project for ending presentations.

                                        The biggest challenge is to reduce the workload imbalance that arises from 
                                        the drastically different time it takes for different parts of the mesh to converge 
                                        (even if they are the same size.) 
                                        The paper we’re following brushes over this since they are using a completely different and 
                                        custom-made parallelization system that serves as an abstraction for lower-level libraries like 
                                        OpenMP and MPI. 
                                        This tool they have, 
                                        which is described in “A load balancing framework for adaptive and asynchronous applications,” 
                                        is a general-purpose system that automatically takes care of load balancing for the programmer. 
                                        So the major challenge of load-balancing is actually not a solved problem and 
                                        we need to figure that out ourselves through experimentation, 
                                        which is what makes our project interesting and technically challenging. 
                                        The version we’re implementing right now is going to use a shared-address space model and be lock-free. 
                                        By following a sequence of synchronization points, 
                                        we will be able to ensure that each processor is working on an independent chunk at any given time. 
                                        We’re using dynamic work assignment in between the synchronization points to keep all the processors busy as much as possible.
